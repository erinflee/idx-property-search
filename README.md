# Agentic AI Real Estate Assistant

A multi-agent AI assistant over California MLS data (CRMLS), built on **OpenClaw**.
Natural-language property search, market analytics, semantic recommendations, RAG
knowledge retrieval, and WhatsApp + email communication.

## Stack

- **Runtime:** OpenClaw (multi-agent orchestration) → WhatsApp channel
- **LLM:** Google **Gemini** (`gemini-2.5-flash`) via its OpenAI-compatible endpoint
- **Embeddings:** local **`sentence-transformers`** (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) — no API key
- **Data:** MySQL `idx_exchange` — `rets_property` (active listings) + `california_sold` (sold comps)

## Repo layout

Organized **by component, not by week** — code is reused across weeks, so it lives once and
evolves. Git history records the timeline; the table below maps weeks → files.

## Setup

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env        # fill in MySQL creds + GOOGLE_API_KEY (Gemini)
pytest                      # run the eval/test suite
```

OpenClaw itself is installed separately (`npm install -g openclaw`) and runs as a background
gateway; see the Week 0 setup notes.
